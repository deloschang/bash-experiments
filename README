Thanks for going through my code!

Platform used: written on Mac OSX using ssh to login
Scripts were tested and executed in the ssh (Linux)

-

Q1: If the dates are invalid, the program will exit

-

Q2: 

-

Q3: The program will stop running if there is no url.txt file
(the first argument). The program will complain but continue
if the URL in the file is invalid (will notify user)

The .html files will be overwritten each run.

Searches for substrings too and includes HTML tags

- 

Q4: Spy.sh will generate temp files for each user then concatenate 
them into spy.log. 

Time periods are calculated in minutes but changing awk can calculate them in 
hours too (I went by the example output on the Lab page)

To maintain accuracy of login times in case the
script is killed, the variable "added${username}" increments total
login time by 1 each loop if the user is already logged in. Then,
when the user logs out, these increments are deducted and replaced by 
the full login time. 

Also, there are "dummy" variables for the bottom 3 lines (the trivia portion).
